            <p className="mb-4">
                I provide services related to the development of websites and digital projects, including design and maintenance.

            <p className="mb-4">
                The Client receives the final delivered product (website or digital project) upon completion. The underlying source code, design assets, and development resources remain the sole property of the Developer.
                The Client will never receive direct access to the source code or development files unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.

                Support and maintenance services are provided free of charge for the first year after delivery, depending on the specific project.
                After this period, continued maintenance and support are subject to an annual fee to cover hosting, server costs, and ongoing service.
                Support requests will be handled during standard business hours (Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CET) and responses will be provided within a reasonable time.

            <p className="mb-4">
                The website or digital project is provided "as is," without any express or implied warranties.
                The Developer does not guarantee uninterrupted availability, accuracy of content, or freedom from errors.
                Use of the delivered product is at the Client's own risk.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The Developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use or inability to use the website or digital project.
                This includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, data, or business interruptions.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Termination of Service</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Should the Client decide to terminate the cooperation or discontinue use of the website, they must notify the Developer through agreed communication channels.
                The Developer will securely remove the website from hosting servers and manage any data according to privacy and security standards.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Both parties agree to attempt to resolve any disputes amicably.
                If resolution is not possible, disputes will be settled in a competent court with jurisdiction over the Developer's location.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Final Provisions</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Prior to commencing cooperation, both parties are required to sign a Cooperation Agreement that formalizes the terms of the partnership.
